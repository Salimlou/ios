<h2>Music App Group Project</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In a team, you will develop a functional music application. It can be standalone, or work in conjunction with MIDI input and/or output. It can also work with audio input.</p>
<p>Students will work in teams of two or three.</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>There are seven deliverables for this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Proposal (5 points; <span class="note">due Tuesday, February 5th</span>) - Must be no longer than one page typed.  Project proposal must explain either (1) the problem your team is trying to solve or (2) why your team chose this project.  Your team will present project proposal to class.</li>
<li>Design (25 points; <span class="note">due Tuesday, February 19th</span>) - Outline format is preferred. The proposal must include:
<ul>
<li>Title of the app</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Challenge(s)</li>
<li>Interface elements</li>
<li>Source (music/sound) requirements</li>
<li>Core functionality</li>
<li>Inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Secondary functionality (not critical features)</li>
<li>Mockup screenshots (drawn electronically only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alpha version (10 points; <span class="note">due Tuesday, March 12th in class</span>). This version is meant to be very raw, to demonstrate that your team has actually started the development.</li>
<li>Test Plan (<span class="note">due Thursday, March 28th in class</span>). This document will be distributed to all students in the class. This document shall have the following sections:
<ul>
<li>App title</li>
<li>Authors</li>
<li>Description of app in 255 words or less</li>
<li>Brief instructions</li>
<li>Controls (for every control screen)</li>
<li>A checklist of at least 5 tasks that you want tested, with a section for comments. Briefly describe each task with proper outcome.</li>
<li>Section for additional comments and suggestions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beta version (<span class="note">due TBD</span>)</li>
<li>Website for app (<span class="note">due April 23rd in class</span>)</li>
<li>Final app to be submitted and presented during finals week (hopefully the CTO and former CEO of Steinway will be in attendance like last year)</li>
</ol>

<p>For each deliverable, only one submission per team is necessary.</p>

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
<p>Your app will be graded on six factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="stress">Functionality</span> - Something that works consistently. Remember, an app with fewer features that work is significantly better than one with numerous features, in which some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Production</span> - I am looking for an app that is polished (e.g., graphics), consistent (e.g., look-and-feel), and reasonably professional.  <a href="http://goo.gl/KxSif" target="_blank">In other words, did you follow the HIG?</a></li>
<li><span class="stress">Complexity</span> - The more original your app is, the better.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Usefulness / Fun</span> - Does your app fulfill a recognized need among professional musicians or educators, or is it just fun (or both)?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Learning Curve</span> - Is the app easy to understand at first, and does it offer a more rewarding experience as the user gets to know it?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Technical Competency</span> - Use <a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code" target="_blank">good programming practices</a>, consistent git commits and pushes, meaningful git commit messages used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidelines and Restrictions</h3>
<ol>
<li>The app shall not be used for organizing or downloading music libraries.</li>
<li>The app shall not be not be a "DJ"-style app for manipulating playback of non-original music files.</li>
<li>Source code shall be in a private GitHub repository that I will provide.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashlytics.com" target="_blank">Crashlytics</a> shall be used to manage and report on crashes on your app.  I will provide each team access to the Tufts University profile.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p class="stress">I have a project request from an instructor in the philosophy
department who is looking for a solution for an interesting idea he
has. He wants his students to be able to listen to a piece of music
and as they are listening they would tap the beat they hear into some
kind of device (possible an iPad). Once the piece has ended he would
be able to project the various student interpretations of beat in some
form of graph.</p>
